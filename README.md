## Is Greek Life "Big" At Lehigh University?
This infographic shows Lehigh Undergraduate Fraternity & Sorority Enrollment Trends for the Spring of 2021. This data came from a Lehigh University Office of Fraternity & Sorority Affairs Trend Analysis Report, which included enrollment data by semester from 2017-2021. I used this data to answer the question, "Is Greek life 'big' at Lehigh University?" This question could be relevant to incoming Lehigh students, current first-year students or students who are not in Greek life. I recently learned that most people outside of Greek life at Lehigh actually know very little about how Greek life operates and how large its presence is at Lehigh. Based on the data I found, I was able to conclude that for a small school like Lehigh, a significant percentage of students are involved in Greek life. I was also interested to discover that there are more females involved in Greek life, despite there being more fraternities than sororities on campus.

## Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment by Sex Across 10 years

This time series chart shows the percentage of male and female undergraduates at Lehigh from 2011 to 2020. Based on this chart, we can see that there has consistently been more men than women at Lehigh, though the percentages have fluctated over the years. In 2017, Lehigh was the closest it has ever been to an equal distribution among the sexes with 51.5% males and 48.5% females making up the undergraduate population that year. This information is relevant to prospective Lehigh students. A lot of high school students pay close attention to the gender breakdown of colleges, as some students prefer to attend a school with more men or more women. This data shows prospective Lehigh students that while there are more men than women at Lehigh, the numbers are still pretty close and tend to fluctuate often.
