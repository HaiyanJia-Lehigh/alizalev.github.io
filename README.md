## Is Greek Life "Big" At Lehigh University?
This infographic shows Lehigh Undergraduate Fraternity & Sorority Enrollment Trends for the Spring of 2021. This data came from a Lehigh University Office of Fraternity & Sorority Affairs Trend Analysis Report, which included enrollment data by semester from 2017-2021. I used this data to answer the question, "Is Greek life 'big' at Lehigh University?" This question could be relevant to incoming Lehigh students, current first-year students or students who are not in Greek life. I recently learned that most people outside of Greek life at Lehigh actually know very little about how Greek life operates and how large its presence is at Lehigh. Based on the data I found, I was able to conclude that for a small school like Lehigh, a significant percentage of students are involved in Greek life. I was also interested to discover that there are more females involved in Greek life, despite there being more fraternities than sororities on campus.
